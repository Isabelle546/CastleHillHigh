    <p class="text-muted">The Creative and Performing Arts are an essential and vibrant part of our school, offering experiences within and beyond the classroom. In each subject we aim to position the students as creative artists, equipping them with skills, techniques and experiences to enable their expression in their chosen form.
      Engagement in the Creative and Performing Arts benefits students academically, personally and creatively. Researchers have found that students who are involved in the Creative and Performing Arts have higher school motivation, engagement in class and academic aspirations, as well as increased self-esteem, life satisfaction and sense of meaning and purpose (Csikszentmihalyi 1990, 1996; Martin et al., 2013). Engagement in the arts also increases student levels of creativity (Cote, 2010). Not only does creativity enrich our lives and form a fundamental part of what makes us human, but politicians, educators and business leaders worldwide have realized that creativity and innovation are central to business leadership and economic success (Business Roundtable, 2005; Sawyer, 2006, 2013).</p>

  <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">More than just a library</h5>
  <p class="text-muted">Castle Hill High School Library provides both print and digital resources to support the learning of students.

    We are dedicated to providing wonderful print, e-book and audio reading choices to encourage reading for pleasure. This is grounded on research that shows that reading widely is essential for intellectual, personal and social development.
    
    The two teacher librarians work as information specialists, liaising with staff to provide lessons focusing on specific skills related to research, ICT, critical and creative thinking and literature across the curriculum. </p>
